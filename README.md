### ALGOZEN PROJECT

This was the assignment given to me by algozen

### Tasks
- [x] Get the name of all the kotlin repos and sort it by stars
- [x] Add a second page 
- [x] Get the README file and stars from the given repo

All the task are completed as was mentioned.

#### Fallbacks
- As there are no icons on the repos, they were not added.
- The Github API does not support GET Request for READMEs hence **raw** README file is presented
